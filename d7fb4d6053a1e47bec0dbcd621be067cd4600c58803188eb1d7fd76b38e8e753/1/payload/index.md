About Autonomy
Hcash is an autonomous digital currency. With a hybrid consensus system, it is built to be a decentralized, sustainable, and self-ruling currency where stakeholders make the rules.



Autonomy (Pi) is a censorship-resistant blockchain-anchored public proposal system, which empowers users to submit their own projects for self-funding from Hcash's block subsidy. Pi ensures the ecosystem remains sustainable and thrives.
